I heard she sang a good song,
I heard she had a style.
And so I came to see her
And listen for a while.
And there she was this young girl,
A stranger to my eyes.

Strumming my pain with her fingers,
Singing my life with her words,
Killing me softly with her song,
Killing me softly with her song,
Telling my whole life with her words,
Killing me softly with her song

I felt all flushed with fever,
Embarrassed by the crowd,
I felt she found my letters
And read each one aloud.
I prayed that she would finish
But she just kept right on.

Strumming my pain with her fingers,
Singing my life with her words,
Killing me softly with her song,
Killing me softly with her song,


She sang as if she knew me
In all my dark despair
And then she looked right through me
As if I wasn't there.
But she was there this stranger,
Singing clear and strong.


Strumming my pain with her fingers,
Singing my life with her words,
Killing me softly with her song,
Killing me softly with her song,
Telling my whole life with her words,
Killing me softly with her song
